This is typically done through computer programming. They are similar to statisticians in that both perform statistical analysis on data sets. However, a difference is they focus on problems and techniques unique to digital data and have an emphasis on prediction and action. I personally believe that the two fields are very similar and don’t necessarily need to be considered separate."
